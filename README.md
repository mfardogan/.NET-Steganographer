# .NET-Steganographer
Steganography library and test application for hiding text or image to another image data.

Steganography is a encryption technique for hiding an information into another digital data. We use image datas while we are making a steganography. Because human's eye can not detect to little changes from an image. It should use image's pixels' LSB bit for a successful steganograpy.
